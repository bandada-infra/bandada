                # Bandada: public goods infra

                Bandada is a user-friendly platform allowing anyone to create and manage private groups of anonymous individuals without needing technical expertise. It supports various types of groups, both on and off-chain, and offers manual or automated management based on eligibility criteria. It serves a wide array of purposes, such as organizing organizational members, GitHub contributors, or NFT holders.

                Bandada caters to **developers** with tools and APIs and **non-developers** with intuitive interfaces, enabling easy creation and management of anonymous groups for entities like DAOs, governments, and non-profits.

            <Accordion label="Group">
                In the realm of privacy and zero-knowledge technologies, the concept of a group takes on a significant role. A group, in this context, is more than just a collection of individuals; it represents an **anonymity set**. This means that within the group, individual members' actions, characteristics, or identities become indistinguishable from one another, providing a way for individuals to engage in collective actions or share attributes without revealing specific information about themselves.

              <Divider.Line />
            <Accordion label="Anonimity VS. Pseudonymity">
                Anonymity refers to the complete concealment of a user's identity, while pseudonymity allows users to interact under a consistent but “disguised” identity.
            </Accordion>
              <Divider.Line />
            <Accordion label="Credential">
                A way to establish necessary trust between a set of participants by verifying certain attributes or qualifications of individuals, without necessarily revealing their _full_ identity and letting users keep control over how the data associated with their identities is stored, managed and used.
