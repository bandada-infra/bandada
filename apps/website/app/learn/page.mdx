            # Bandada: public goods infra

            Bandada is a user-friendly platform allowing anyone to create and manage private groups of anonymous individuals without needing technical expertise. It supports various types of groups, both on and off-chain, and offers manual or automated management based on eligibility criteria. It serves a wide array of purposes, such as organizing organizational members, GitHub contributors, or NFT holders.

            Bandada caters to **developers** with tools and APIs and **non-developers** with intuitive interfaces, enabling easy creation and management of anonymous groups for entities like DAOs, governments, and non-profits.

            <Accordion label="Group">
                In the realm of privacy and zero-knowledge technologies, the concept of a group takes on a significant role. A group, in this context, is more than just a collection of individuals; it represents an anonymity set. This means that within the group, individual members' actions, characteristics, or identities become indistinguishable from one another, providing a way for individuals to engage in collective actions or share attributes without revealing specific information about themselves.
